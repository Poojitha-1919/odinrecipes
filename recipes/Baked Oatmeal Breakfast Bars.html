      <p>This Oatmeal Breakfast Bars recipe is basically like oatmeal in bar form for on-the-go breakfast and snacking. 
	They are more substantial and healthier than a packaged breakfast bar, and can be easily customized with different
	 add-ins based on preferences. Made with staple pantry items, these are easy-to-make and can be stored for a few 
	days or frozen for months!
